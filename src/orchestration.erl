%% 1. Call manager:deliver/1 to get a route assigned.
%% 2. Reserve space for a set of parcel being picked up from one city to another,
%% ensuring no other truck picks them up using manger:reserve/3.
%% 3. The selected vehicle needs to appear in the sender's city and load the reserved
%% parcels using manager:pick/1.
%% 4. When in a city, you can decide if you want to pick up other parcels within the
%% vehicleâ€™s weight allowance using manger:reserve/2 that have not been
%% reserved or do nothing.
%% 5. Decide if you want to transport the parcel to the receiver or a cargo station.
%% 6. If the parcel is in the cargo station, decide if it should be transported to another
%% cargo station closer to its final destination.
%% 7. It is enough for a van to reach a city for a parcel to be picked up or delivered.
%% Use manager:drop/1 to deliver the parcel.
%% 8. End your round in a cargo station dropping off all remaining parcels you picked
%% up en route using manager:transit/2. Find your closest cargo station using manager:cargo/1.
